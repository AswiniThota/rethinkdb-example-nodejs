This little example illustrates
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford's_law">Benford's law</a> using
Twitter's streaming API. Benford's law refers to the frequency distribution of digits
in many (but not all) real-life sources of data. In this distribution, the number 1
occurs as the leading digit about 30% of the time, while larger numbers occur in that
position less frequently: 9 as the first digit less than 5% of the time[[Wikiepdia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford's_law)].
